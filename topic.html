 <p>Cyber-warfare is the deliberate act of nation-states or international entities attacking another nation systems through cyber means such as viruses and ransomware. (Libicki, 2009 p.23) In recent times the prevalence of such attacks has become more common. Examples such as Stuxnet, SolarWinds, and Wannacry show significant nation-states such as Russia, the United States, and China. The majority of government-sponsored attacks launched against other governments aim to demonstrate a state's capabilities rather than cause real catastrophic disruption. Governments are ramping up their cyber operations, and signs show that they are increasingly targeting commercial organisations. (Sobers, 2020) Attribution against said attacks is known as one of the most challenging aspects of cyber warfare. ( Oaganini, 2016) For example, in response to these attacks, the US has indicted individuals who work for the Chinese, Russian and North Korean Militaries. These individuals are protected from being deported out by their countries, and little action will be taken unless they leave their home country.

<p>When it comes to countries' national security worldwide, the importance of safety and warfare is obvious. The escalation of conflict between countries rising as a result of said attacks is the main worry. In a report by the Cyentia institute, they found that nation-states were responsible for 43% of 103 major global cyber incidences resulting in 7.5 billion dollars in damages. (Machtiger, 2021 p.3) It is worrying to see global powers such as the US and Chinese governments take a backseat approach to the attribution of cyber attacks, downplaying the risk they play to the public. James Clapper, the director of the National Intelligence Agency of the USA, has repeatedly downplayed cyber attacks in the past, simply referring to them as "passive intelligence collection activity--just as we do." (NBC News, 2016).In what is now known as the "Equifax hack", a 2017 breach has led to the belief that 145 million US citizens consumer days has been provided to Chinese companies and intelligence agencies. (Machtiger,2021 p.21)
We also need to consider the ethical dilemma when nations charge individual actors who committed crimes on behalf of orders. According to Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law professor, the indictments against the individual "embarrass the people they name and show that the United States has the ability to find people who are hacking into the country," rather than an attempt to stop said attacks. (Lucas, 2019). While the 60+ indictments since 2019 have only led to 15 arrests. ( Logan 2019) These actors still face arrest in over 100+ countries with which the US has an extradition treaty. Not only this, but with their name out in public, they became a target and defeated their primary goal of secrecy. (Hinck & Maurer 2019). While this is used as a deterrence to prevent people from working for their attacking nation-states, is this fair of them to put these charges on people who only are working to do their job? While unfair to the actor, these indictments are used as a scapegoat for nations to prevent escalating tensions. Gary Brown, a professor of cybersecurity at the Marine Corps University, states that "we are moving the bar pretty far, and we need to think about the implications." He also believes that the lack of action by the US is sending a message that they will allow higher levels of hacking into both private and government sectors. (Dilanian,2016)
