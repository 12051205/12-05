<p>Cyber Warfare is the act of a Nation-state or international entity attacking another states network(RAND, n.d.) through cyber means through a virus or other means. In recent times the prevalence of such attacks has become more common. With attacks such as Stuxnet, Solarwinds,  and Wannacry, we see participation from major nation-states such as Russia, United States, China and Israel. In reaction to the increasing attacks and in direct response to what is known as the US and China came to a cyber espionage agreement in 2013, in which both parties agreed to not attack the latter, however, whether or not the parties follow the agreement is questionable. Attribution of said attacks can be known as one of the most difficult aspects of cyber warfare. Not only do hackers tend to cover up their tracks, but falsely accusing another nation of an attack can lead to serious diplomatic and trade conflicts(Oaganini, 2016) In response to these attacks, the US has indicted certain individuals who work for the Chinese, Russian and North Korean militaries. However, due to said individuals having connections to their home governments, whether they say publicly or not, nothing ends up happening. According to Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law professor, the indictments against the individual “embarrass the people they name and show that the united states has the ability to find people who are hacking into our  country,” rather than an attempt to stop said attacks. (Lucas, 2019) In an article by NBC,  we can see that all countries involved are equally likely to sponsor cyberattacks, out of the public eye of course. James Clapper the director of the National Intelligence Agency of the United States has repeatedly played down Cyber Attacks in the past referring to them as “passive intelligence collection activity-- just as we do”. The indictments of the individuals are used as a metaphorical painting over the cracks. If the US were to start blaming the Russian government for their attacks, it could also potentially the methods which they use to find intel that could cause more harm than good. ((Dilanian, 2016)</p>
<p>When it comes to the national security of countries across the world, the importance of cybersecurity and cyber warfare is obvious. As of now, the escalation between countries rising from repeated attacks is the main worry. Since 2017 Cyberattacks associated with nation-states have had a 100% rise in “significant incidents.(Bernard, 2021) It’s worrying to see the united states take a back seat approach when it comes to the attribution of cyberattacks and downplay the risk they play to the public. One also needs to consider the ethical dilemma when nations charge individual actors who committed crimes on the behalf of orders. While the 60+ indictments since 2019 have only lead to 15 arrests(Logan, 2019), these actors face arrest in over 100 countries with which the US has an extradition treaty. Not only this, but with their name now out in public, it defeats the hackers main goal of secrecy.  (Hinck & Maurer, 2019) While this is used as a deterrence to prevent people from working for the attacking nation-states, is it really fair for us to put these charges on someone who only aims to do their job? While unfair to the actor, these indictments are used as a scapegoat for nations preventing escalating tensions. Gary Brown, a professor of cybersecurity at the Marine Corps University, states that “we are moving the bar pretty far and we need to think about the implications.” He also believes that the lacks take the US is taking is sending a message that they will allow higher levels of hacking into private and government sectors. With nation-states continuing to prove into other nations, there also proses the risk of private citizen data being leaked aswell. It is clear that the importance of cyberwarfare and our policies around it need to change soon before it is too late.</p>
