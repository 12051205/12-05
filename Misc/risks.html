<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p>The page or area describing the risks posed by your chosen technology/topic.<p></h4>

<p>The act of cyber warfare has risks not only follows those of normal cyberattacks but also has the risk of potential war. With the rising tensions between the US, Russia and China, we are seeing a greater emergence of state-sponsored attacks. Previously the US has indicted individuals from these attacks. 
  this could allow countries to increase attacks without fear of starting wars
       to what extent would these attacks increase\
  By calling these cyber attacks criminal activity, “ Gary Brown, says “we are not going anywhere near  war and conflict.”Russian Hacking: Why the U.S. Isn't Retaliating (nbcnews.com)
  ·         Risk of private citizen data loss
  ·         War
  ·         Economic loss, from attacks on private businesses
  By calling out countries on their state-sponsored cyber-attacks instead of the person conducting the attack the individuals being hired by the countries are not deterred from conducting these attacks again as all risk is being taken by the government of the said country. Whilst this does put pressure on governments to not conduct cyber-attacks depending on their intention with the attacks this may not deter them and in this case, the only group that would be affected would be whoever was attacked.
  In James A. Lewis’s paper Assessing the Risks of Cyber Terrorism p. 10, Cyber War and Other Cyber Threats he talks about how it is easier to recover from the damage done by a cyber-attack than a physical attack, then when a government sponsors a group of individuals to conduct a cyber-attack it is very risky for those individuals as they are the ones that will tend to be prosecuted if the attack is traced back, even with countries blaming the governments for state-sponsored cyber-attacks it can be hard sometimes to then trace the attack back to the government from the group of attackers. This means that even though the governments of the attacked country try to trace the hack back they may not find that the hacking organisation was hired by a government and then will have to prosecute the individuals which means that the governments will be free to hire another group of hackers without deterrence.
  In Martin Libicki’s book Cyber Deterrence and CyberWar p. 7 he describes the 2 ways to deter cyber-attacks “deterrence by denial (the ability to frustrate the attacks) and deterrence by punishment (the threat of retaliation)”, the deterrence in this case would be the prosecution of the government/hackers responsible while the denial would be to increase security in areas to make it difficult for the hackers to the point where they are unable to carry out the attack. The risk of increase security is that you may miss some crucial point in which case the attack will be able to be carried out. If the governments are willing to hire attackers even after seeing the risks of what may happen if the attack is traced back to them then the risk may not be high enough, in this case the deterrent would have to be bigger. However when deciding on how to react to a cyber-attack, governments must be careful to avoid all-out war as this allows open hostility between both sides that means cyber-attacks are more likely to happen alongside physical attacks. And whilst it is easier to recover from a cyber-attack nowadays, a cyber-attack combined with a physical attack will cause major problems as the systems taken down may not be able to be repaired for a week or months on end.
  State-sponsored cyber-attacks will always stick to the edge of the line of what counts as warfare compared to criminal attacks, and by staying at the edge of this line which is drawn by the government being attacked they can get away with doing a lot of damage. An example of this is the pipeline incident which happened very recently in the US, the pipeline was shut down briefly due to a cyber-attack and came back online, however, due to the media the news of the attack caused panic among the citizens and this caused more damage as people caused gas prices to rise by thinking there was going to be a gas shortage. By this small attack caused by some hackers, the damage was much larger as things spun out of control however it will be viewed as a criminal attack rather than terrorism.
