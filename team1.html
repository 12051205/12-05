<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>
<p style="pad">
Cyber Warfare has severe consequences for everyone whether a person is involved or not.  Nation-state actors who perform cyberattacks are employed by the government to harm opposing nations therefore the individuals involved see their action as a way to serve their country believing what they are doing is ethical. But the opposing nation which is harmed doesn't see it as ethical.
  <br></br>
The consequences of government decisions for the actions taken are weighted on the shoulders of those individual hackers entirely when they were merely following orders in which they didn't have a say in. Governments find it easy to use nation-state actors as convenient scapegoats when they should be the ones taking liability for their actions that have been committed through their orders. Since the actions wouldn't happen if the order weren't given in the first place. This is a major ethical dilemma because the actors involved can comprehend the impact of their actions but the government leaves them with no choice but to follow orders.
    <br></br>
I believe that nation-state actors shouldn't be held responsible for the damages caused by cyberattacks but the government itself should be held responsible. Because nation-state actors only followed orders set by government officials.  It is not ethical for the government to exploit people for their own self-centered reasons which are a natural byproduct of using nation-state actors as a scapegoat. They are forgetting that in the universal declaration of Human rights: Article 5 states "No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment".</p>
