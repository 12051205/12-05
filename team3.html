<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>
<p style="pad">
There are many ethical issues around cyber warfare as the goal of it is to cause harm to others. As a government it is easy to make hard ethical calls as the people being effected are not your own and they tend to be used to having to make decisions that can negatively impact people for what the government sees as the greater good. However because these governments are outsourcing the job to groups of individuals and this can make decisions harder as the lives of potentially millions of innocents are in the hands of a few people who have been tasked to destroy them.
  <br></br>
Personally I think that it is disgusting that governments will force these ethical and moral problems onto one group of people, as this means that a group of higher up officials are taking all the moral decisions that they would have to make and put it in someone elseâ€™s hands, which is essentially cleaning the blood off their hands.
    <br></br>
I think that the governments should take the brunt of the blame for cyber-attacks that are linked back to them as they are the ones that decided that a cyber-attack should be committed against a foreign state. Even though the group got to make the call that they would commit the attack sometimes they have no choice but to commit the attack as some governments can pull strings so that the hacker groups cannot say no. and therefore I think the governments should be taking the blame IF the hack can be traced back to them. The reason I say if is so that groups do not fake being associated with the government as to cause bad political relations with other countries.
